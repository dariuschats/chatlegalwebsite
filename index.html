								<h2>Meet our team</h2>
								<h4><b>Darius Hii - Legal Practitioner Director</b><br>
									LLB, BCom(Finance), Member of the Queensland Law Society, Chartered Tax Adviser (Taxation Institute of Australia), Member of the Society of Trusts and Estate Practitioners</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile-pic-final-darius.jpg" alt="" /></span>Having worked alongside some of Australia’s best tax and estate planning lawyers, Darius founded Chat Legal with the goal of spreading essential legal knowledge to others. With a young family of his own, Darius understands the importance of structuring his affairs (both personal and business) for the benefit of his loved ones and has built his practice around ensuring his clients appreciate this too. Having seen how costly and stressful issues arising from poor tax and estate planning are on clients, Darius is a firm believer of “prevention over cure”. Darius’ hope is to never be required to resolve issues arising from poor planning and makes it his focus to be that trusted advisor to prevent poor decisions from being made. This means spending that extra bit of time explaining difficult legal concepts to clients so that they are able to avoid making common faults in estate planning and business and investment structuring.  When not spending time with his family, Darius can be found up late on weekends (and extra early on some weekdays) listening to the audio commentary of European football (soccer) games.</p>
