								<h3>Timely</h3>
								<p>No one likes to wait around for food or other services, so why should legal solutions and advice be any different.  If we cannot respond to your email or get you your documents prepared in a timely and reasonable manner, then we have failed in our service commitment to you.</p>

							<section>

								<h3>Convenience</h3>
								<p>We understand how busy life, kids and business can get.  This is why we offer our advice and availability to you at a time convenient to you (whether during or after standard office hours) in a manner convenient to you (whether online, over the phone, in person at our office or at a location of your choosing).</p>

								<h3>Technology</h3>
								<p>We leverage technology to enable us to deliver our legal solutions and advice in a timely and convenient manner.  This allows us to create efficiencies and gives us the confidence to only offer fixed prices for our legal solutions and advice.  Further, through the use of technology, we are also able to offer more for less and have created 'Freebie apps'’ providing useful information and solutions.</p>

							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-lock accent5"></span>
								<h3>Fixed prices</h3>
								<p>We don’t like unexpected invoices, so why should you.  We only commence work once a fixed price is agreed for a legal solution or advice, and the preferred method of delivery.  If instructions or circumstances change, we will not invoice you for more than the fixed price unless a change in the price is agreed beforehand.</p>

								<h2>Meet our team</h2>
								<h4><b>Darius Hii - Legal Practitioner Director</b><br>
									LLB, BCom(Finance), Member of the Queensland Law Society, Chartered Tax Adviser (Taxation Institute of Australia), Member of the Society of Trusts and Estate Practitioners</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile-pic-final-darius.jpg" alt="" /></span>Having worked alongside some of Australia’s best tax and estate planning lawyers, Darius founded Chat Legal with the goal of spreading essential legal knowledge to others. With a young family of his own, Darius understands the importance of structuring his affairs (both personal and business) for the benefit of his loved ones and has built his practice around ensuring his clients appreciate this too. Having seen how costly and stressful issues arising from poor tax and estate planning are on clients, Darius is a firm believer of “prevention over cure”. Darius’ hope is to never be required to resolve issues arising from poor planning and makes it his focus to be that trusted advisor to prevent poor decisions from being made. This means spending that extra bit of time explaining difficult legal concepts to clients so that they are able to avoid making common faults in estate planning and business and investment structuring.  When not spending time with his family, Darius can be found up late on weekends (and extra early on some weekdays) listening to the audio commentary of European football (soccer) games.</p>

Our legal advice is limited and reliant on you asking questions (we will prompt you with an 'issues to consider' list). Document solutions available for purchase are listed and categorised under the menu bar. <br> </p>
