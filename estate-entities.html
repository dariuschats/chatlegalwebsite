					<h2>Trust and company succession</h2>
					<p>If you have a trust or a company, it is important to understand that assets held in those structures will not always be dealt with under your Will.</p>
				</header>
				<div class="box">
					<span class="image featured"><img src="images/estate-entity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Instead, a variety of issues must be considered to properly understand how control of those structures pass upon various events occurring (such as death or lose of capacity of a controller).</p>
					<p>Depending on the intentions relating to the succession of such entity, simple or complex succession plans can be drawn and prepared in relation to each entity.</p>
					<p>Understanding the complexity of such plans will also depend on the current circumstances which would require a proper understanding of the governing rules of the entity and the financial circumstances.</p>
					<p>An overview of the relevant issues to be considered regarding the succession plan of a trust or company is provided below.</p>
					<h3>Trust succession considerations</h3>
					<il>
						<li>Who takes control of the trust if you pass away or lose capacity?</li>
						<li>Who do you want to take control of the trust?</li>
						<li>Does the trust document state who the successor controller is?</li> 
						<li>Are there multiple roles that can control the trust? </li>
						<li>Is there provision in the trust document enabling a successor to be nominated?</li> 
						<li>Can the successor be nominated by Will? </li>
						<li>Can you update the trust document to include broad provisions to reflect your estate planning intentions?</li> 
						<li>Can you update the trust document to hardwire specific beneficiaries or controllers?</li> 
						<li>How are multiple controllers to act? </li>
						<li>Is a particular asset intended to be set aside for a certain beneficiary?</li>
					</il>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Company succession considerations</h3>
					<il>
						<li>Shares can only be dealt with under a Will if an individual owns the shares in their own right (i.e. not as trustee).</li>
						<li>Who should take control of company if the shares in the company are held by a trust?</li> 
						<li>Does the company constitution or shareholders agreement outline a successor director? </li>
						<li>Are the provisions in the company document restricting who may be a shareholder of the company?</li> 
						<li>Can the company constitution be updated to embed a successor director if you were to pass away or lose capacity?</li> 
						<li>Can strategies be implemented to ensure particular assets in the company pass to specific recipients?</li>
